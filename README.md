# 10-OOP-Employee-Profile

## Description
For this project, I am using the command line to prompt questions in order to create an employee profile. By using this, a manager will have easy access to their employees information. In creating this, I have learned how to utilize test-driven development to ensure everything is working as it should, and how to add information plugged into the command line to be added into a html website.
